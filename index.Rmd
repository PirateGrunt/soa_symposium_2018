* Seeing numbers
* Seeing hypotheses
* Seeing models

# Seeing numbers

## The Zen mountain

“Before I studied Zen, I saw mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers. When I had studied Zen for thirty years I no longer saw mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers. But now that I have finally mastered Zen, I once again see mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers.”

> Ch’an master Ch’ing Yuan

## Seeing a thing is not the same as seeing a thing

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('images/oldenburg.jpg')
```

## The Treachery of Images

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('images/MagrittePipe.jpg')
```

## Visual representation of the number 17

## Sanskrit

```{r}
# knitr::include_graphics()
```

## Binary

## Bavarian

## 

Arabic/sanskrit no more legitimate than any other representation

_We can no more see numbers than we can hear, smell or taste them._

## Many numbers - statistics

Statistics maps a set of many numbers into a smaller set of numbers.

_The summary is not the same as all of the numbers!!_

##

```{r}
tbl_obs <- tibble(
  observations = rnorm(10e3)
)

tbl_obs$observations %>% 
  summary()
```

## Many numbers visually

```{r}
plt_hist <- tbl_obs %>% 
  ggplot(aes(observations)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```


# Seeing hypotheses

## 

Stats always compared to prior belief. Requires assumptions

1. Form of distribution
2. Parameters ==> Moments of distribution

## 

Histogram and pdf

##

Histogram and many pdfs

## 

We have just tested a model, visually

## Kolmogorov-Smirnov

```{r}

```

##

_For stochastic processes, all of the numbers is not the same as the process!!_

# Seeing models

## 

## Trees

## Variable importance



## Neural networks?

# Conclusion

## Wrapping up
